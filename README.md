# Logistic Regression on Titanic Dataset

## Content

In this project I'm attempting to do data analysis on the Titanic Dataset. In the first step I'm doing a very quick data exploration and preprocessing on a visual level, plotting some simple plots to understand the data better. Then I've done some data cleaning and built a **Classifier** that can predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## Tools and Packages

In this project I've used the following tools and Python packages:
* **Jupyter Notebooks:** This is the software that lets us run Python code in the browser and intermix markdown with cells containing code.
